8/12/2024 12:15:20,educator,Black,The Policy seems very inclusive. It covers not only the N Word but all hate speech.,I am worried that the disipline for most of the offenses wil end up faling on the shoulders of our young black male students who have had this word engrained in their vocabulary. I can see how a teacher/staff could manipulate the disipline part to better suit their wants.,"The biggest excuse I hear when I correct children for using the N word is, ""I didnt use the one with the ER at the end."" it would be nice if this policy could state the N word and all variations of it.

8/12/2024 20:37:38,educator,Latino/a/x,Clearly and unapologetically names the need and request and provides accountably and data collection. ,"More specific need to further define how data will be disaggregated, shared, and used.  Also, needs more specific language around aligning this work to ethnic studies law and other district initiatives to show how it plays a role in the whole system, specifically how it aligns with restorative practices (which the policy states) by describing what some language can be that adults as well as youth can use to address the need for historical awareness, the negative impact of the community if this word is allowed to be used, and offer students a way to recover and grow after violating the n-word policy so that we grow those who understand and advocate for language that promotes divinity  ",Thank you for doing this work and sorry for my ruuuuuunnnn on sentences ,Thank you for your bravery,Andrea Gil ,
8/13/2024 14:48:32,educator,Black,"I am glad that the policy specifically references the N word.  As we know, this word has historical and contemporary usages that often function differently than other racial slurs or hate speech in general.  I also like how the policy specifically names Black students as a group when making considerations for uninteneded consequences.  HUSD, like many majority BIPOC school districts, has huge problems with anti-Blackness often coming from other people of color.  It is important to name how Black students are unfairly disadvantaged by this prejudice and discrimination.  ","The definition of hate speech on the first page of the proposed policy appears to solely reference categories of identity that are guaranteed protection under state or federal law.  I believe the definition should extend beyond protected characteristics.  National data shows that when students are bullied as the result of a characteristic, the most common characteristic is physical appearance (followed by other identities named in the policy such as race, gender, ethnicity, disability and perceived or actual sexual orientation).  Physical appearance can reference body size, colorism, texturisim or featurism.  Colorism and featurism can impact all people of color while texturism primarily affects people with African ancestry.  Bullying based on size includes but is not limited to height and weight.  Weight bias is often fatphobic in nature.  I would love for the definition to include these other categories.","In the recruitment and retention of staff section, I would change “provide mentorship and support for new teachers, particularly those from diverse backgrounds” to “provide mentorship and support for all staff members who are new to their profession, particularly those from diverse backgrounds.”  Novice certificated support staff members, classified staff members and administrators would all benefit from mentorship and support though it is often lacking for these staff members in comparison to what is provided for new teachers through BTSA.  ",I greatly appreciate the work that has been put into this policy. It is clear that HUSD stakeholder input was gathered thoughtfully.  I also like how the work of Zetha Nobles and others in New Haven Unified was utilized in the development of this policy.,Maya Walker,

In order to safely use the n-word in the classroom and on campus without creating or triggering an atmosphere of discomfort & danger, our students would need to be educated regarding more history than can be taught beginning in 9th grade.
